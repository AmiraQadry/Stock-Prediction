# Stock Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The LSTM model will be trained on historical stock price data and used to forecast future stock prices.

## Dataset

The project utilizes [historical stock data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500). The dataset should include the date and the corresponding stock price.

## Setup

Install the necessary libraries:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - keras

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the data:
   - Load the stock price data into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Preprocess the data by scaling it using a `MinMaxScaler` to ensure all values are between 0 and 1.

2. Split the data into training and testing sets:
   - Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. Typically, around 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.

3. Build the LSTM model:
   - Build the LSTM model using the Keras library.
   - The model architecture typically consists of one or more LSTM layers followed by a dense layer.

4. Compile and train the model:
   - Compile the model by specifying the optimizer and loss function.
   - Train the model using the training data.

5. Make predictions:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.

6. Evaluate the model:
   - Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE).

## Conclusion

Stock prediction using LSTM can be a challenging task, but it offers the potential to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can build an LSTM model to predict stock prices and gain insights into the potential future trends of a given stock.
